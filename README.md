Planning
----------
### Definition of the problem
The context of the installation of the car rental system is as follows. 

It is obvious that the new systemâ€™s purpose is to outperform a previously used system, which might have been unsuitable for its purpose, inefficient, redundant or simply out-dated. 

This new system will only replace the software of the previous system, while the hardware, people working on it and the immediate environment will most likely remain the same. However, the knowledge required to utilize and use the system would change, and thus retraining of relevant personnel would also be necessary.

It is also essential to examine the 5 TELOS principles. The technological aspect of the previous system would be sufficient to sustain the new system. Based on assumptions, the economic impact would be beneficial because of the increased efficiency of the information flow and storage. The legal, operational and schedule feasibility is quite irrelevant, and would not change while exchanging systems.
