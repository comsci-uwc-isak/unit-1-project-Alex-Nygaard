### Questions
(No questions at the moment)

### To-do
* Ensure the frame script is dynamic when considering the length of the text

### What did i learn
* Deeper understanding of flowcharts
* Nesting loops
* Interesting insight into computational thinking in the regards to the need for breaking up a problem into smaller problems (as we did with the flowchart)

### Other reflections from class:
##### What are the topics 4.1.6 (p.186) and 4.2.4 (p.220) and how do they link to what we did in class?
* Topic 4.1.6 is about iterations associated with a given decision in a specified problem. During todays class we used this concept a lot, especially when making the frame-making script (using loops). 
* Topic 4.2.4 is about analysing an algorithm presented as a flowchart. We did this while collectively making a flowchart for the frame-script.
